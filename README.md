# TheBigGirlGameBrowser
This project will replicate the non-commercial part of a game store, assisting with visibility for games and developers and make it easier for users to find games and decide if they want to buy them (add to wishlist) with several different moderated functions. Game developers can submit games (to be approved by admins) and view statistics on their game, such as views, how many users have it on their wishlist, etc. Users can then add tags (which is like categories or aspects of the game) to games, vote on them, review a game (a rating with mandatory description/reason, which also have comments and votes for each), and add games to their wishlist. Users can search or browse the entire list of games with advanced searches, looking for specific tags, review/rating thresholds, and games similar to ones they have positively reviewed in the past or put on their wishlist.  Administrators can moderate games, tags, reviews, and users. One unique thing about this application is that it will allow game developers to search for potential areas of viable development, looking for tags that historically havenâ€™t had any/few good games among other aspects.
